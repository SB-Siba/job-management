                        Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) offer
technical education in various trades
and skills that prepare students for
employment in specific industries. ITIs
focus on providing vocational training
to develop skilled technicians and
craftsmen.
Diploma in Engineering programs offer a
comprehensive education in engineering
principles and practices. These programs
bridge the gap between ITI training and a
full engineering degree, providing more
in-depth technical education. A Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) or
Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree
offers comprehensive education and
training in various engineering
disciplines, focusing on both theoretical
concepts and practical applications.</p>

Security is the state of being protected against threats or danger. It encompasses measures and practices designed to safeguard individuals,
 organizations, and assets from various risks, such as physical harm, theft, and espionage. Effective security involves 
 implementing policies, procedures, and technologies to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats. It includes physical security measures like locks and surveillance, cybersecurity strategies such as firewalls and encryption, and procedural safeguards like access controls and employee training. Overall,
 security aims to ensure safety, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources and information.</p>
